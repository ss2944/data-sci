    "# Introduction\n",
    "Abstract\n",
    "In the following report, we will attempted to identify whether a relationship exists between the U.S. economic environment and the performance of the North American movie industry. Specifically, we will looked at the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the economy affect the overall number of tickets sold?\n",
    "How does the economy affect the performance of different genres? Through a wide array of analysis, we have determined that the relationship between the economy and overall number of tickets sold is extremely strong. However, when take a closer look at the relationship between economic performance and genre market share, we found that most genres maintain a small but consistent market share, but the adventure and drama genre are strongly affected. The relationship is as follows...one rises, one falls, linear relatinship, etc.\n",
    "Background\n",
    "(literally none of this is right, need to do research ^.^) In recent years, the movie industry is becoming more globalized and finding the need to balance the sanctity of box-office premieres with the streaming demands. Ticket sales are dropping and movie theaters are becoming experiential instead of the primary medium for movie-goers. Moreover, market volatility is increasing, with three economic downturns in the past fifty years with only a few in the past hundered. By identifying how economic trends impact movie ticket sales and how economic performance affects movie genre preferences, the box-office movie industry can get a better pulse on consumer economic response. Specifically, companies can figure out whether they should releasing more box-office movies, and whether they should target a specific genre.\n",

    "Composition\n",
    "Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we have compiled a dataset that contains the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Total box office tickets sold in North America, market share based on genre in North America, annual % change in U.S. GDP, and change in annual % change of national U.S. income in chained dollars\n",
    "Observations: The data spans the years 1995-2018\n",
    "We specifically measure genres based on market share to remove any variation atrributable to change in movie tickets sold. Additionally we use GDP and income because GDP enables us to measure the health of the United States while income measures the economic health of individual consumers. We use chained dollars for income to account for inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is not designed to represent a larger population or to be extrapolated geographically. We are specifically looking at how the preformance of the U.S. market impacts the performance of the North American box-office movie industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has two key components: movie information and economic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie information was scraped from the Numbers, a data analytics organization with the following mission: 'The Numbers was officially launched on October 17th, 1997 as a free resource for industry professionals, the investment community, and movie fans to track business information on movies.' The data collection was funded by Nash Information Services, a movide industry consulting service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the form of a csv. The government keeps track major economic indicators to aid them in making economic decisions. This data was funded by the U.S. government.\n",
    "\n",
    "People were not involved in any of the data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Ticket sales was recorded by ticket sales. Market share by genre was found by first sorting movies based on eleven key genres. From there, the number of tickets sold for movies under a specific genre during a specific year were summed and divided by the total number of tickets sold. Government data is collected and analyzed the the BEA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in our creation of the data, we did some processing. First, we selected the data range 1995-2018 because the Numbers data began at 1995 and we wanted to ensure that the annual data was in its entirety and felt that 2019 data might not be as accurate. A\n",
    "\n",
    "We also created an \"Other\" genre category, for genres such as Westerns, which have a market share of less than 1%. We decided to do this because if a genre captures less than one percent in the market, then any changes in them could be due to noise. For example, maybe a specific movie becomes really famous and draws attention to the genre. This does not mean that economic changes impacted consumer preferences. Moreover, since the market share is so low, any variation is magnified in proprtion to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Influences on the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key sources could impact the data. First, illegal movie streaming or \"pirating\" movies is a major concern in the box-office industry. Therefore, number of tickets purchased does not necessarily represent number of views. Secondly, movies are sorted based on genre, but a movie could fall under two different catergories, especially a popular one. This may cause a skew in favor of one genre over the other.\n",

    "From the correlation Coefficient and Spearman Correlation data, most of the genres have a more non-linear than linear realtionship with GDP. However, only two genres, Adventure and Drama, have an absolute value of spearman correlation higher than 0.5. This means that for a majority of the genres, although there there is more of a non-linear relationship than linear, there is little correlation between the two variables. This means that an increase or decrease in the market share of those genres does not lead to an increase or decrease in GDP. The change in GDP is more than likely randomly correlated to those genres and their relationship is mostly random. However, for Adventure and Drama there is more of an correlation which is non linear for both genres. The Spearman value is closer to an absolute value of 1 for both genres than their correlation coefficient values. This shows that there is a more non linear realtionship between the genres' market share and the GDP. As market share for Adventure increases, there is usually some sort of non linear decrease in GDP. As market share for Drama increases, there is usally some sort of non linear increase in GDP. This all boils down to this: Based off the correlations between Adventure and Drama with GDP, when the economy is doing well, Drama movies are made more and do better than usual. When the economy is doing poorly, Adventure movies are made more and do better than usual.\n",

This will mainly be a test for the genres of Adventrue and Drama as they had much higher correlation values than all other genres. There seems to be little correlation for the other 6 genres so we will not test them. Also, we will use n = 1000 to ensure that there are enough random samples."
