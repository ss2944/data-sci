    "# Potential Problems with the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This data has some limitations that should be taken into consideration when analyzing the results. Firstly, this data is restricted to the popularity of \"box office\" movies and does not consider other mediums for watching movies. Therefore, even though a certain genre may be popular in theaters, another type of genre may be trending through other mediums such as streaming services and DVD rentals/purchases. However, movies were a popular medium until more recently, so by going back to 1995 in terms of research collection, we can mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this data is limited to the period of 1995-2018. Therefore, it takes into account only one major economic downturn, the Great Recession, and is therefore a small sample size when considering the impact of the economy on movie preferences. This data may demonstrate correlation, but it is difficult to state causation becuase a genre may simply be trending at the time due to other external factors. Although it is hard to state causation, it will still be interesting to see if a correlation does exist. Maybe people prefer horror and are more pessimistic when the economy is down!\n",
    "\n",
    "A third limitation is that the medium through which users engage with a genre varies by genre. For example, users that enjoy musicals are more likely to go to Broadway than movie theaters. However, by restricting our question to movie popularity, we can minimize the impact of user medium preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this data is for the United States, but there could be potential skews in popularity based on metropolitan versus rural considerations. More people might prefer watching horror, but since movie theaters are more accessbile in metropolitan areas, popularity might be skewed towards urban area preferences."

    "\n",
    "* Additionally, we noted the number of movies made, so that we can normalize market share percentage by production percentage. If only 2 movies are made in a genre but it caputes 20% of the market share, this is more noticible than a genre with a 100 movies made and the same market share.\n",
    "\n",
    "*State of the Economy*\n",

    "* We use Personal Consupmtion Expenditure (PCE) to determine how much consumers are willing to spend. We were orginally going to use the Consumer Pricing Index (CPI), but PCE is less impacted by inflation and incorporates all household expenses, not just out of pocket expenses.\n",

    "**Movie Data**\n",
    "* This data is recorded by ticket sales. The movie industry accurately records this data because it helps it evaluate performance.\n",
    "* Another source of influence includes the genres in which the movies are sorted. A movie could fall under two different categories and attract two different audiences, but for simplification, were placed into one category, probably based on which the movie \"most\" fell under.\n",
    "\n",
    "**U.S. Government**\n",
    "* This data is recored by using \"bundles\" and putting weights on each item in the bundle. Therefore, decisions on the bundling and the weight provided would impact what was recorded.\n",

    "### What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "**Movie Data**\n",
    "* This data was found by first finding the number of tickets sold per movie and the category under which each movie falls. Then the labels and the sums for each genre were made accordingly. Then finally, the percentages per genre were found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Data**\n",
    "* This data was probably collected by finding industry market size and multiplying it by the percentage weights associated with the PCE. \n",
